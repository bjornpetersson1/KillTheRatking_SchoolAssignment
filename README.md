The game should have a couple of enemies with specific moving-patterns.  
  - Snake - runs away from you when you get close  
  - Rat - moves randomly one step in any direction

Both player and enemies can attack and the attacked unit should also preform a counterattack.  
The attack and defence are calculated by dice throws.
